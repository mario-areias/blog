**Why**

`i hack to protect` was born so it can live as notes of my research around Application Security. The word `hack` here is not meant to be pejorative or synonym to do illegal things. Here the word `hack` is related to [passion, cleverness and the love to build and share things for the common good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture). Everything I research or build is with the goal of making web a safer place.

**Me**

My name is Mario and I am a Brazilian software developer with a passion for security. Builder/Breaker. He/him.
