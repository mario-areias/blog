Last week, I had the opportuniy to attend the awesome [AppSecDay](https://appsecday.io/). It was such an incredible event where I could present of what I know about AppSec and watch many other great talks too. I was so glad to see developers with different levels of security expertise to showing up to improve their security skills. Great shout out to all AppSec organisers!

It was a very inspiring event that made me reflect on many things regarding AppSec and security in general. I didn't know what kinda of public would attend AppSecDay. In my mind it would be an event attended mostly by security professionals. I was very surprised to see that around 60% in the audience were developers like me! I was so happy to see a big turn out from them. 

There were some great talks at the event and I managed to watch a few of them. All of them were recorded, I believe, and will be available at some point. In this blogspot I want to talk what AppSecday made me reflect upon.

## AppSec is confusing

*DAST, SAST, RAST...so confusing*

AppSec, as mentioned by [Matt Jones](https://twitter.com/volvent) in his brilliant talk, is a very confusing field at the moment. Tooling seems to be such an important topic. Matt made a joke about vendors being almost as bad as attackers in this industry. I couldn't stop laughing! It is very easy to get lost with all those tools and acronyms being thrown out at us and we lose sight of what is important. **Build secure products**. That is (or should be!) the end goal for any Software/Security engineer.

## Tooling is not a goal

AppSec is a confusing industry but it also is a very hard one. The balance to get products shipped constantly while having proper security control is very hard to find. This balance varies from company to company and the only way to find it is to work closely with developers. As partners. Treating security as a first class citizen.

*This is collaboration right there!*

We need to bring security to developers and get them closer to security. We can't do that by throwing tools at their pipelines like there is no tomorrow. Tooling without proper context and understanding is pointless. I do not think the whole focus on tooling is healthy. Lack of tooling is not the problem most companies face. The real problem is how to bring developers and security together. Working as a team to both deliver quickly and securely.

## We need more developers!

Traditionally, security worked in a silo. From a distant place they delivered reports, requirements and blocked features as they seen fit. That clearly did not work at that time and it will not work now.

We will only get AppSec right when security gets to understand developers and vice-versa. AppSec, at the moment, is being taking over by security professionals. Which is great! They definitely bring values and expertise to the table. But they are not enough. Security is only one part of the equation. We need more developers to join this industry. Developers have much better insights in how to integrate security in the SDLC than security people do. Developers bring expertise of Agile methodologies and application development. Developers are obsessed by delivering value early and often. This is a much needed behaviour in application security. Developers will keep us honest to what tool/process will work for them and the best way to collaborate with them.

Events like [AppSecDay](https://appsecday.io/) are super important to get developers onboard. But we also need to be mindful that we need to talk their language. Metasploit, WAF and whatever tooling is hot at the moment is of little importance on the big picture. Education, security awareness and understanding attack vectors are much more important at the beginning of the journey. 

I definitely will be attending AppSecDay next year, as well as, submiting other talks. However, next year I will submit talks for developers. From one developer to another. Security needs to be treated as first class citizen. And developers as well.
